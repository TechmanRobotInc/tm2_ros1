# __TM ROS Driver Usage and Installation__
The TM ROS driver is designed to interface the TM Robot's operating software (__TMflow2__) with the Robot Operating System (ROS) so that program developers and researchers can build and reuse their own programs to control the TM robot externally.

## __1. Usage and Installation__
> * This manual is for <u>**ROS1 Noetic**</u> vs _TMflow2_ version.<br/>
>> :bulb: The operation interface of _TMflow2_: Navigate to __â‰¡__ and click to expand the function menu, including the icons __Login/Logout__, __Connect__, __View__, __Run Setting__, __Project__, __Configuration__, and __System__. Please refer to _Software Manual TMflow_ ([SW2.14_Rev1.00](https://www.tm-robot.com/zh-hant/wpfd_file/software-manual-tmflow_sw2-14_rev1-00_en/)).<br/>
>
> * Just clone the TM ROS driver of the git repository into your working directory and then build it.<br/>
> * The user can directly return to "__5. TM External GUI Debugging and Demonstration__" introduced above: then refer to steps 1 to 4 of this chapter __&sect; Use the demo code and drivers on an external Linux PC__.<br/>
>
> &#10148;  After installing the correct ROS version of the computer, the next step is to ensure that your hardware, control computer, and TM Robot are all properly configured to communicate with each other. See below to make sure the network settings on your computer are correct, the TM Robot's operating software (_TMflow 2_) network settings are ready and the __Listen node__ is running.<br/>
<div> </div>

## __2. TMflow Listen node setup__
The __Listen node__: a socket server can be established and be connected with ROS by an external device to communicate according to the [defined protocol](https://assets.omron.eu/downloads/manual/en/v1/i689_tm_collaborative_robot_software_manual_tmflow_version_2_operation_manual_en.pdf). The user can make the robot communicate with the user's ROS (remote) computer equipment through a wired network when all the network parameters in the _Network setting_ are set.<br/>
>
> 1. Create a _Listen task_ of flow project of __TMflow__ software, and then drag the __Listen node__ from the __Node List__ menu (&rArr; Communication &rArr; Listen) onto the project flow, as shown below.
>
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/listen_task.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 2. Set the `Network` settings: mouse-click to enter the page of __System &rArr; Network__ in order.  
> &#10148; Example: Set the Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 and IP address 192.168.10.2 <br/> 
>> **Note**: Set the network mask, and the communication with the TM Robot must be in the set domain.<br/> 
> 
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/network_setting.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 3. Set the __Ethernet Slave__ `Data Table Setting` item: mouse-click to enter the page of __Setting &rArr; Connection &rArr; Ethernet Slave__ in order.<br/>  
> &#10148;  We recommend _one easy method_ <sup>1</sup> to set the __Ethernet Slave__ `Data Table setting` to directly import the software package.<br/>  
> <sup>1</sup> See [TM ROS Driver vs TMflow Software Usage: Import Data Table Setting](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/TM_Export).<br/>   
>
> A previous traditional method as follows:  (Note: TMflow software version changes may have slightly different settings.)  
The user can manually click the `Data Table Setting` <sup>2</sup> item and check the following boxes as item _predefined_ <sup>3</sup> to receive/send specific data: 
>

>       - [x] END_DI0~DI2
>       - [x] END_AI0
>
>    <sup>2</sup> <u>Turn off</u> Ethernet Slave. Let "STATUS:   __Disable__" displayed on the Ethernet Slave setting page, then click `Data Table Setting` to enter the next page for related settings.

<br/>

   <img src="./figures/manual_set_specified_transmit_file.png" width="1000" height="360">

>    <sup>3</sup> The checked items listed above must <u>all</u> be selected for TM2 ROS setting.
>
>    When you need to check more about the __maximum, minimum, and average calculation properties of joint torque__ <sup>4</sup> listed below, these _three checked items_ can be checked individually or all of them, please leave them unchecked when not in use.

>
> 4. Enable the __Ethernet Slave__ settings: mouse-click to enable or disable TM Ethernet Slave. Once enabled, the robot establishes a Socket server to send the robot status and data to the connected clients and permissions to access specific robot data.<br/>

###  &sect; __Remote connection to TM ROBOT__
> Static IP of remote connection network settings through the wired network.<br/> 
>
> 1. Set the wired network of the user's (remote) Ubuntu computer by mouse-click on the top right of the desktop &rArr; Click on "__Wired Settings__" &rArr; Click on the gear icon &rArr; In the IPv4 feature options, click on "Manual" in order.<br/> 
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/user_remote_network_settings.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 2. Set the Static IP settings: where the IP address is fixed for the first three yards same as the previous setting 192.168.10, last yards 3-254 machine numbers are available. (Because _TM ROBOT_, you have been set to 192.168.10.2)<br/> 
> &#10148;  Example: Set the Netmask: 255.255.255.0 and IP address 192.168.10.30 <br/>
<br/>

   <img src="./figures/user_remote_IP_example.png" width="1000" height="500">

> 3. Check Internet connection: start a terminal to test the connectivity with the target host _TM ROBOT_, by typing ping 192.168.10.2
> 
<br/>

   ![ping_target_host](./figures/ping_target_host.png)

>> :bulb: **Tip**: Remember to reconfigure the network settings due to <u>static IP changes</u> or <u>replacement of the ROS control PC</u>.<br/>
>> As mentioned above, a valuable debugging tool is your operating system's <u>ping</u> command. If nothing appears to happen or an error is thrown, the robot cannot be accessed from your computer. Please go back to the top of this chapter and re-operate in the order of instructions.<br/>
>> If you are an experienced user, you may just need to <u>turn off</u> &rArr; <u>turn on</u> the gear icon of "__Wired Settings__" on your computer or to <u>turn off</u> &rArr; <u>turn on</u> the "__Ethernet Slave Data Table__" setting of the robot to reconfigure the hardware settings.<br/>

###  &sect; Common usage of TM ROS driver 
> __ROS1 driver usage__ through the Listen Node<br/>
> :bulb: Do you prepare the __TM Robot__ ready ? Make sure that TM Robot's operating software (__TMflow__) network settings are ready and the __Listen node__ is running. Do you build TM relative ROS apps <sup>1</sup> on your (remote) computer?<br/>
> After the user has set up the ROS1 environment  and built the TM driver relative ROS apps <sup>1</sup> based on the specific workspace, please enter your workspace `<workspace>` by launching the terminal, and remember to make the workspace visible to ROS.<br/> 
>
> ```bash
> source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
> cd <workspace>
> source ./devel/setup.bash
> ```
> Then, run the driver to maintain the connection with TM Robot by typing 
>
>```bash
> rosrun tm_driver tm_driver robot_ip:=<robot_ip_address>
>```
> Example :``rosrun tm_driver tm_driver robot_ip:=192.168.10.2``, if the <robot_ip_address> is 192.168.10.2
>
> Now, the user can use a new terminal to run each ROS node or command but don't forget to source the correct setup shell files as starting a new terminal.
>
> &#10146; <sup>1</sup>  The user can download the TM driver relative ROS apps [Experimental TM2 Noetic ROS Apps](https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tm2_ros1) of the GitHub repository for ROS applications.

> The __Vision node__ provides the creation of a plane with fixed-point type, servo type, and object type as well as a variety of AOI identification functions.
> TM ROS Driver can receive the source image from the vision job (with External Detection) and publish it as a ROS topic.<br/>
> The following describes how the user can acquire image data through TMvision&trade; of TM Robot. **(Built-in Vision System)**
